# Developing Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the developing Tic-Tac-Toe game project. This project is a work in progress...

## Current Status

This Tic-Tac-Toe game project is currently under development. We have implemented the basic game mechanics, but there is still work to be done to make it a fully-featured game.

## Features

- Classic 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Two-player mode: Play against a friend (implemented but incomplete).
- Reset the game at any time (implemented but incomplete).
- Exit the game and return to the main menu (implemented but incomplete).
- Responsive design for various screen sizes (incomplete).

## How to Play (In Progress)

Instructions on how to play the game are still a work in progress. We will provide detailed guidance on gameplay once it's complete.

## Installation

You don't need to install anything to run the game in its current state. Just open it in your web browser and see the progress.
